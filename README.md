# AngularSimulation

Under Construction......
This project simulates performance testing for obstacle generation, rendering, heatmap integration, and PDF generation. Built with Angular 9.1.4, it leverages libraries such as Konva.js to analyze and compare performance metrics.

## Project Overview
The AngularSimulation project includes the following core functionalities:

1. Obstacle Simulation

Simulates obstacle generation, rendering, drag interactions, zoom, and position and color changes.

2. Heatmap Rendering

Tests rendering speed for heatmap layers integrated with obstacle display, using libraries such as simpleheat.

3. PDF Generation

Simulates PDF generation performance with datasets, testing libraries such as jsPDF, pdf-lib, and pdfmake.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
